# random-wallpaper
Random background images from Unsplash. Has the option to convert the images to 8-bit, if the user prefers.

Available for Wallpaper Engine on Steam [here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1565912187).

### Bugs
- Pixelation value isn't reobtained when refresh button is clicked
    - Temporary fix: switch wallpapers to see your new pixelation value

### Ideas
- Once I get this project all fancy and working properly, repeat but with random Google Maps
streetviews. Then you can end up with views like [this](http://www.mapcrunch.com/p/42.454622_1.533792_79.26_-5_0)
and [this](http://www.mapcrunch.com/p/65.649017_-37.323824_-206.74_-5_0) as your wallpaper.
- Look into seeing if the link can be retrieved and saved to a WP Engine property, at least until
the creator is able to design a workaround for allowing me to save the image directly to the
user's system. 
- Make the refresh button draggable and the position (possibly) persistent.
    - Add a toggle for whether to display the button, and make the color customizable. Theme color?
- Make the theme color be picked from the random image automatically.
- Add the option to choose the resolution of the images retrieved, ex. 4K vs 1920x1080.
    - Add several other API options, such as images from a key word.
