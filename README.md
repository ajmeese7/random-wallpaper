Random background images for Wallpaper Engine

Available for Wallpaper Engine on Steam [here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1565912187).

- Once I get this project all fancy and working properly, repeat but with random Google Maps
streetviews. Then you can end up with views like [this](http://www.mapcrunch.com/p/42.454622_1.533792_79.26_-5_0)
and [this](http://www.mapcrunch.com/p/65.649017_-37.323824_-206.74_-5_0) as your wallpaper.
